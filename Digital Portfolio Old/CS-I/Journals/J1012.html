	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3>1.1: Describe the <em>general</em> process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
	<p>Align the digits vertically, then add each column from the right to left, during which, if the result of a single sequence of addition is 10 or greater, we carry the double digit to the column on the left.</p>
      </div>

	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
	<p>The number "8" doesn't exist in the octal number system, so when numbers become 8 or greater, they carry over to the column to the left.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="section3">
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3>3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
	<p>The values of the letters used to represent numbers greater than 10 should be considered, as well as the difference in the maximum quantity that can be represented by a single digit.</p>

	<h2>Section 4</h2>
	<h3>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing additionn with binary numbers?</h3>
	<p>There are only two numbers in the Binary System, so when you add two "1"s together, the number would carry and leave a "0" behind.</p>

	<h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
	<p>I learned how to perform addition with various number systems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>I was confused with how the addition in the binary system worked, being there only two numbers.</p>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	<p>This experience is really well made.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	<p>I now realize how to perform different additions with different bases.</p>
