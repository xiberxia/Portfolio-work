	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3>1.1: Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
	<p>The while loop first tests if a section of code should be run, but a repeat-while loop first runs the section of code, and then tests if it should repeat and run aforementioned code again; the repeat-while loop will always run the code at least once, while the while loop may not.</p>
	<h3>1.2: What are the minimum amount of times that this loop will execute?</h3>
	<p>The repeat-while loop will always run the code at least once.</p>
	<h3>1.3: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after <i>Consequent</i>?</h3>
	<p>The instruction causes the code to Jump back to the beginning of the sequence of code within the "while" loop.</p>
	
      <div id="section2">
	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3>2.1: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a <i>while</i> loop using a <i>repeat-while</i> loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
	<p>No, because in the repeat-while loop, the section of code will be run before a test is made to see if the machine should repeat it. A while loop might not allow the section of code to be run at all, as it first tests if said code will be run.</p>
	<h3>2.2: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
	<p>Yes, as a coder can make it so the included section of code will only be run once by manipulating the variable.</p>

	<h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
	<p>Repeat-while loops will first run the included section of code before testing if it should be repeated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>I initially had difficulty finding the difference between the repeat-while loop and the 'normal' while loop.</p>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>"How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	<p>I found the explanations very clear.</p>
