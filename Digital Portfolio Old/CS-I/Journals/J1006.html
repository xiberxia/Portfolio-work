    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1 What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>The git that’s been committed, it’s ID, it’s creator and at what time it was created.</p>
   
    <h3>1.2 What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>Both note a “master.”</p>

    <h3>1.3 What do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>I believe it represents the person who ‘owns’ the git repository.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="section2">
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>2.1 What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They’re displayed in red.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>No, they’re not displayed in the same section. File1.txt is under “modified,” while file2txt is under “Untracked files.”</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div id="section3">
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1 What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They’re displayed in green this time.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>File1.txt is under “modified” while file2.txt is under “new file.”</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div id="section4">
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>4.1 How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>Two files have been listed to have been changed.</p>
    <h3>4.2 What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>The differences are displayed in green. “+This is a new line” has been added to the file1.txt, and under file2.txt, is “+This is a new line in.”</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div id="section5">
    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Execute the commands. What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>The commands do not elicit a response from the shell, because there are no differences between the committed and the current files.</p>

	<h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
	<p>I learned how to use git and why it's useful: to save and have a backup file of a previous version of a project.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>I found challenges when I accidentally did things out of order, and I was occasionally puzzled by the questions it provided, especially the ones listed in Section 3 and Section 5.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	<p>Clearer instructions and explanations after each question could be provided.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	<p>Saving is important and using git helps us do that.</p>
