    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to make various logic gates with only a single one. It was very satisfying when I finished the excercise and excursion.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>Making a XOR gate out of NAND gates from scratch was the most strenous part of the experience for me.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I didn't really know what the Excursion section was asking for initially. It took some time for me to realize exactly what I was supposed to make.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I've gained a new respect for computer scientists back in the day when computers were a new thing.</p>
