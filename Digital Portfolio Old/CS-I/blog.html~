    <h2>The Cruel Chromebook Order</h2>

    <p>Using purely school devices with their tiny screens of minute amount of pixels would be a danger to everyone's eyesight. Having to squint down upon their compact screens has always proved uncomfortable, and doing so for longer periods of time will harm people's eyes. Their extremely slow speed only causes further frustration. This miniscule screen also creates a discreptancy for those who use screens of different size, which will cause a jarring learning experience as people switch between personal devices and the chromebook.</p>
