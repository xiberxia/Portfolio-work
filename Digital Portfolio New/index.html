          <h3>Computer Science</h3>
          <p>I've been studying Computer Science at Allen High School for three years, and have since gained experience in <b>Swift</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b> by working in a Linux environment.</p>
          <li class="cs_achievements">Beginning at the <i>Fundamentals of Computer Science</i>, where I learned about computer hardware and various basic programming concepts, I was able to quickly acclimate myself to the subject. </li>
          <li class="cs_achievements">In <i>Computer Science I</i>, I was introduced to the Linux shell, where I would create the first rendition of my Portfolio in HTML and CSS, as well as practice and learn the Swift coding language using the Emacs editor. </li>
          <li class="cs_achievements">Finally, in <i>Computer Science II</i>, I continued developing my Swift skills, learning about algorithms, and also begin on an Independent Study Project with a team to create a working mouse from scratch. I also worked with a team to participate in the CyberPatriot Cybersecurity Competition as well as the PicoCTF 2024 Competition.</li>
