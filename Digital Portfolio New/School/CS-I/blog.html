        <h3>The Government and the AI</h4>
    
        <p>I think the government should have their hand in AI regulations. AI is a rather dangerous concept because of what people might be able to do with it, and having an overarching regulation that might prevent something dangerous from happening will be for the better, even if it is restricting. Services like ChatGPT might be harmless, but also be used for ill. A government has the necessary abilities to be able to influence AI's negative impact on our world.</p>

    <h3>The Cruel Chromebook Order</h3>

    <p>Using purely school devices with their tiny screens of minute amount of pixels would be a danger to everyone's eyesight. Having to squint down upon their compact screens has always proved uncomfortable, and doing so for longer periods of time will harm people's eyes. Their extremely slow speed only causes further frustration. This miniscule screen also creates a discreptancy for those who use screens of different size, which will cause a jarring learning experience as people switch between personal devices and the chromebook.</p>
