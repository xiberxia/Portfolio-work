    <div>
      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <h3>1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model.</h3>
      <p>Ans: Discord and the search engine Google are both server-client models.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <h3>2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
      <p>Ans: It's important for different people to be able to create directories under the same name (under a same grandparent directory) because they could be doing similar projects and use similar directory names. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The special figure could be there to help clarify that it's the home directory, and can be used to represent it as the name of <i>home directory</i> can be too long.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>4.1: After typing "cd Merlin," did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The prompt changed, as I've entered another directory. This is like a folder to contain files, and within a unique directory, I can create files with the same name as in other directories. This is also helpful in sorting information and files and such.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>5.1: What happens each time you press the 'up button'?</h3>
    <p>Ans: When I press the 'up' button in the home directory, the command I previously entered appeared.</p>

    <h3>5.2: What happens each time you press the 'down button'?</h3>
    <p>Ans: When I press the 'down' button in the home directory, the command I've just entered reappears.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 6</h2>
    <h3>6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The text "hello world" didn't appear. Instead, I presume it was copied (redirected) to the out.txt file.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 7</h2>
    <h3>7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The <strong>ls</strong> command lists all the files and directories that occur <em>after</em> the current directory. Meanwhile, the <b>tree</b> command lists every single directory in a chart fashioned like a family tree.</p>
    
    <h3>7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>Ans: When I want to see every single directory and file  branching out from my current directory, to see <em>every</em> option that's available, I'd use the 'tree' command. If I just wanted to just see, on a smaller scale, the directories and files that exist just in my current directory, then I'd use the 'ls' command. </p>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 8</h2>
    <h3>8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The sleep command could change in duration depending on the number typed behind it.</p>

    <h3>8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>Ans: I can prove my hypothesis by putting "sleep [x]" into the shell and timing how long it takes for the shell to "wake up" again.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 9</h2>
    <h3>9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The behavior is not much different from what I expected.</p>

    <h3>9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>Ans: To run a job in the background means that you can run another job as it's running (in opposed to running a job in the foreground, where other jobs cannot also be run).</p>

    <h3>9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>Ans: It seems like the number affects the number of seconds the "sleep" lasts.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    
    <div>
    <h2>Section 10</h2>
    <h3>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the <b>jobs</b> command?</h3>
    <p>Ans: There's a list of the jobs that are currently running.</p>

    <h3>10.2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>Ans: The command that initiated each job is listed, from most earliest to latest.</p>

	      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
	      <p>I learned to navigate and use the basic functions of the shell.</p>

      <div>
	      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	      <p>Memorizing the commands and their applications I've learned so far has proved to be the most difficult part of this experience.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
	      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	      <p>It seems to be very knowledgeful already, and is great at explaining information.</p>
