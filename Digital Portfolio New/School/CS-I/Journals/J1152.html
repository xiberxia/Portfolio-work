	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3>1.1: What is the test executed <i>prior</i> to the loop?</h3>
	<p>Is the number less than or equal to four? Four is subtracted from the initial number.</p>
	<h3>1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are similarities? What are differences?</h3>
	<p>Both loops test for a boolean value, but the while loop can re-occur by itself any amount of times. A conditional will only occur by itself once.</p>
	<h3>1.3: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?</h3>
	<p>It resets the loop to before the boolean question is asked.</p>

	<h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
	<p>While loops can re-occur any amount of times as long as a boolean value remains true, but will eventually have to end. I also learned more about analyzing machine code.</p>

      <div class="jsummary">
	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>I initially had troubles describing the differences between a conditional and a while loop.</p>

	<h2>"How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	<p>I found the explanations very clear.</p>
