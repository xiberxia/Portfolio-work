    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>Not found.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
    <p>Four out of five days last week was a break, so my scheduling and homework organization are frazzled with some courses ahead in work while others behind.</p>

    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
    <p>Some of my project partners in English aren't always available for discussion online and it's stifling our progress in our group project.</p>

    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>There was difficulty deciding in what medium our ISP project would be predominately planned in, as I needed a place where I can write paragraph of information and organize them like they're boxes in a flowchart. Because Google Docs only organizes information straightfowardly, chronologically, Google Docs was not a valid option. While Google Slides exist, it is only redominately</p>

    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>I had a little difficulty figuring out a certain part of the Merlin missions assigned this week, where the prompt was to create code that would solve for the area of a heron triangle. By using heron's formula, the proccess becomes very simple, but I soon found out that Swift didn't have a built-in square-root function. I searched for various ways to square-root a number, and it was only on the third day when I realized that I had to import something called "Foundation". Afterwards, creating the rest of the program was very simple.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
    <p>I often find very little time left in my day to do my hobby, writing fiction. I simply get caught up in consuming other forms of media that I find writing so slow compared to them, and I become reluctant to write. But, I should simply write more in order to get back into the groove.</p>

    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
    <p>My friend and I have a small asssignment to complete in Chinese III class, where we talk in Mandarin and discuss a topic, practicing our interpersonal speaking skills. We've had to prepare outside of school in order to organize our thoughts and get together a general outline of what we'll present during class.</p>

    <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>Changing the password of my AISD account proved to be confusing endeavor. When logging into my computer at Computer Science class, I discovered that we needed to change our passwords for the semester. Thus, I followed the process displayed on-screen. Yet, every attempt at the "confirm" button was to no avail, even as I made my new password more and more complex. I wondered: where could I find a set of instructions about password requirements? I logged into Skyward on my phone, which redirected me to the AISD Portal. I found a password-changing place there and quickly followed the instructions to reset and change my password. After pressing "confirm" on my phone, I went to check on the computer if the password changes had succeeded, and fortunately, they did!</p>

    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
    <p>After returning home from my first day at school, I sighed in great relief as I relaxed into my office chair. Time to take a break from school! Yet, this was my biggest mistake of the day, and led to many hours of procrastination. That night, I resolved to take on a more productive mindset after returning from school in the future. This would increase both my efficiency and the amount of sleep I get every night.</p>
    
    <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
    <p>At home, I'd often come into conflict with my mother about helping my brother with his homework. Occasionally, he'd bring home an assignment of which he's unsure about the answer, and my mother always implores me to help. But, I knew that if I answer his doubts, he'd ask me more questions in the future, and I didn't want to be troubled by such things. It'd also be more beneficial to his own learning if he figured out how to solve his own problems by himself. Thus, I redirected his attention to emailing the teacher about his questions, or using in-class-given resources.</p>

    <h2>Project roles</h2>
    <h3><u>(Software) Development Engineer</u></h3>
    <p>Designs, develops, and then tests the software of an intended digital product; they should have good programming skills and knowledge, but also be good at problem-solving. Software engineers directly interact with the product most often and must be able to proficiently use computer languages such as Swift, Java, HTML, etc. When I think of myself in the role of a software-development engineer, I feel like I am lacking in my knowledge in coding. But, I believe that the more I work on unique computer science projects, the more I'd learn about software development.</p>

    <h3><u>QA Engineer</u></h3>
    <p>QA stands for "Quality Assurance," and like the name, QA engineers look for bugs in the code of a product and work with other developers to fix them. They use various tests to find potential problems so that on release, customers would be satisfied with the product. They should be well-versed in coding languages so that they can identify where in a product's code is a bug originating from. Though I have a decent understanding of coding languages and the flow of logic within them, I know that my current skills could prove to be lacking in more complex projects. I'd need to learn more about coding to become a proficient QA engineer.</p>

    <h3><u>Project Manager</u></h3>
    <p>They are in charge of directing the whole project from beginning to end, managing the teams, deadlines, and resources that the project may have. A project manager should be organized, have a calm desposition, and must be good at communication, having to be able to transfer information between teams in the project and deliver information of progress to stakeholders of the project. I think I would've been a good project manager if not for my tendency to forget. This, however, can be remedied by the use of tools such as alarms and planning tools.</p>

    <h3><u>Product Manager</u></h3>
    <p>The product manager interacts with the potential customers of the product and makes sure that the project will be of value to the consumers and provide profit to the people working on the project. They interact with and help direct the other people involved with the project so to create a tangible and succeeding product. Similar to with being a project manager, they must have great communication, time management, and a calm desposition, but also have knowledge in business. Unfortunately, I am not great at managing time, nor have proficiency in business. Alarm-reminders and digital calendars can help with time management, and taking a class can help with learning more about business.</p>

    <h3><u>Release Engineer</u></h3>
    <p>Release engineers make sure that a product is ready for release, namely, ensuring is ready for duplication and distribution and overseeing the release of the product, and then working with other engineers after release to provide updates to the product. They should be familiar with coding languages so to be able to implement fixes to the product, as well as be skilled in management so to be able to work together with other engineering departments to do so. I think I'd be alright at release engineering and my main roadblock to it is again, proficiency in coding.</p>
