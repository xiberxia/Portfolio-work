	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3>1.1 What syntax errors do you notice in the above code?</h3>
	<p>It is impossible to edit variables who have been set using the "let" term.</p>

	<h3>1.2 What logic errors do you see in the above code?</h3>
	<p>When you set x as y in line 4, they are then the same number, and the number that x originally represented would no longer exist. Thus, when you set y as x in line 5, nothing changes.</p>

	<h2>Section 2</h2>
	<h3>2.1 What will be the value of <b>x</b> after the code executes?</h3>
	<p>It will gain the value of y.</p>

	<h3>2.1 What will be the value of <b>y</b> after the code executes?</h3>
	<p>It will not change</p>

      <div id="section3">
	<h2>Section 3</h2>
	<h3>What must be done to properly swap the variables></h3>
	<p>A third variable (for example, <i>z</i>) must be created to temporarily hold the integar of the first variable that swaps (<i>x</i>), and then you must swap the other variable (<i>y</i>) with to the integar that <i>z</i> z represents.</p>

      <div id="section4">
	<h2>Section 4</h2>
	<h3>Will the above code compile correctly> If not, why not?</h3>
	<p>It will not compile correctly because the function is changing a variable that has been set outside of the function, and it will protect against that.</p>
      </div>

      	<h2>Section 5</h2>
	<h3>Carefully compare the above code segment to the previous segment. What changes are required to modify the value of a (value-type) argument in a function?</h3>
	<p>"inout" is added to the function declaration line right before the declaration that the variable "n" is an Integar. When calling the function, an ampersand sign is also added right before "x".</p>

    <div class="jsummary">
    	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>Looking at the inout part of the function was kind of confusing.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="jsummary">
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>I think it was pretty clear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="jsummary">
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea?"</h2>
      <p>I learned about the inout part of the function and the ampersand we needed to add if we wanted to edit variables that we use in the function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="jsummary">
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>There are more methods that I need to learn from swift that are useful.</p>
